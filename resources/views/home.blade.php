He returned and tried in vain to divert his attention to his examination notes.  He went to bed a little after midnight, and was awakened from lurid dreams in the small hours of Monday by the sound of door knockers, feet running in the street, distant drumming, and a clamour of bells.  Red reflections danced on the ceiling.  For a moment he lay astonished, wondering whether day had come or the world gone &hellip;</p>

Nowhere had I seen my host, nor did I know where he kept himself by night. I was on the point of stepping boldly out into the room when a slight noise behind me warned me back into the shadows of a recess in the corridor.

"Of course he's stuffed," replied Dorothy, who was still angry. "That's why he went over so easily," remarked the Lion.  "It astonished me to see him whirl around so.  Is the other one stuffed also?"
